## Responsive Dashboard with React, Vite, and Tailwind CSS

### Overview
This project is a responsive dashboard application built using React, Vite, and Tailwind CSS. It was developed as a code-along project following a YouTube tutorial by 8Kra. Through this tutorial, I gained valuable hands-on experience in modern frontend development, learning how to set up a Tailwind CSS project, design reusable components, and integrate data visualization tools effectively.

### What I learned 
- Setting up the environment: initialize a React project configuring Tailwind CSS for styling. 
- Responsive components: I practiced creating adaptable and reusable UI components that enhance UX. 
- Styling with Tailwind CSS: explored Tailwind's utility-first approach to quicly and efficiently style components. 
- Implementing data visualization: integrated Flowbite for presenting data visually, a critical aspect of dashboard design. 
- Creating responsive designs: I ensured the dashboard adapts seamlessly across different screen sizes, making it user-friendly on any device.
